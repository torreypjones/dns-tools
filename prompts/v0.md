Create a DNS Tools component with the following features:
1. Input field for a single domain or bulk domains (textarea for multiple)
2. Dropdown to select DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, NS, CNAME, SOA, ANY)
3. Dropdown to choose popular nameservers (e.g., Google, Cloudflare, OpenDNS)
4. Option to compare results from two different nameservers
5. Button to perform DNS lookup
6. Results display area showing:
   - Queried domain(s)
   - Selected record type
   - Chosen nameserver(s)
   - DNS lookup results
7. For comparison mode, show results side-by-side
8. Error handling for invalid inputs or failed lookups
9. Copy results button
10. Export results as CSV option

Use a clean, modern UI with responsive design. Ensure the component handles both single and bulk domain queries efficiently.
